    "This notebook will illustrate how the Networkx adapter can be used to perform graph analytics tasks on graph data stored in ArangoDB. For this example we will use the IMDB movie review dataset. The dataset provides reviews of various movies by viewers. The details of the dataset are available [here](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/). If we use a relational representation to analyze this problem, then we will need to know what we want to look in the data and then seek it from the data. For example we may be interested in the average rating for a particular genre of movies. The point here is that we need to know the questions that are important in the analysis of this problem apriori. When we use a graph representation of this data, then we can leverage the body of ideas used in network analysis (or social network analysis) to extract insights from the data. The body of ideas are the standard questions we seek answers to when analyzing any network. The answers to these questions will provide us insights about the data and the problem. In other words, we have a framework for extracting insights from the data. In the example provided in this notebook, we will use ideas from the analysis of bipartite graphs to illustrate this point. Of course, if we have a specific question that we are seeking the answer for, then that is available easily from the graph as well. Therefore, going with a graph represenation makes it easier to extract insights from the data.t\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of using a graph representation for the data extend beyond mining and learning from the data. Running adhoc queries for analytic purposes on the data is more efficient with a graph representation. With a relational representation, we can only optimize query performance for queries that are known before hand (with indexes). Adhoc queries could require multiple joins and have poor performance. Most graphs, have the so called _small world effect_. In such graphs, most nodes can be reached from most other nodes with a small number of edge traversals. An adhoc query starting at any node can reach the node of interest in a few hops.\n",

    "The illustration in this notebook is organized as follows:\n",
    "1. Loading the data for the example.\n",
    "2. Creating the Networkx graph from the AranogoDB graph using the Networkx Adapter.\n",
    "3. Analysis of the graph using Networkx.\n",
    "4. Using the Networkx graph to obtain a graph embedding using _Node2vec_.\n",

    "## Bipartite Clustering\n",
    "The next idea that we will investigate on the graph comes from [Latapy et.al](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0611631). In this work, the authors extend the notion of clustering coefficients associated with a node to the case of bi-partite graphs. Since our graph is a bipartite graph, we will use this metric. See section VIII of the paper for a detailed explanation of the idea. Briefly, the clustering coefficient for a pair of nodes $u, v$, is defined as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "cc(u,v) = \\frac{N(u)\\cap N(v)}{N(u) \\cup N(v)},\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* N(u) is the neighborhood of node $u$. These are the nodes connected to $u$. For example, the movies user $u$ rates.\n",
    "* N(v) is the neighborhood of node $v$.\n",
    "Reviewing the above equation, it is evident that the clustering coefficient captures the shared neighborhood for a pair of nodes. Nodes associated with high clustering coefficient have many common neighbors. In the context of this problem, a pair of users with a high clustering coefficient suggests that these users have rated many movies in common. Similarly, a pair of movies with a high clustering coefficient suggests that these movies there are many common raters(users) for these movies. Networkx provides an implementation of this idea. The details of computing the clustering coefficients for the users and movies are shown below.\n",
    "To obtain the clustering coefficient for a node $u$, we simply average the clustering coefficient of $u$ with other nodes that it shares common neighbors with. It is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "cc(u) = \\frac{\\sum_{v \\in N(u)} cc(u,v)}{\\left| N(N(u) \\right|},\n",
